title: "Workshop: reproduce a complex panelled figure"
bibliography: intermediaire.bib

In this workshop, you will reproduce **Figure 2** from [@Ong2020] (from the cleaned data [located here](../data/covid.csv)) and write a short report explaining your choices, results, and limitations.

## The Figure

Figure 2 contains three sub-panels:

 A.  a clustered heatmap with sample annotations,
 B.  longitudinal expression profiles for inflammatory genes,
 C.  longitudinal expression profiles for T-cell markers.

## Detailed instructions

Work in groups of 3–4. 

Start with each subfigure individually to break up your workload. For example:

  * create a project,
  * save the dataset ([located here](../data/covid.csv)) in the project's folder and load it in the environment,
  * reproduce first the subfigure showing the expression profile of IL1A with `ggplot2`,
  * create a function from the previous code that takes as input the name of the gene and outputs the figure,
  * create subpanels B and C with `patchwork`,
  * work on reproducing the heatmap with `ComplexHeatmap`,
  * combine everything in one big panel.

Write your comments describing your work in an R Mardown document, with an HTML output, breaking down the steps.

At the end of the day, present your work: what you achieved, where you had difficulties, the questions you had. We will show you our own version.
