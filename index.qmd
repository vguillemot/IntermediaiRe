# Objectives

The objective of this class is to show students how to combine their skills in R programming to create reproducible reports with R Markdown, along with publication ready figures. The course ends with a workshop during which students will be asked to work in teams on a dataset extracted from a recent publication, reproduce some or all the figures from the paper, and propose alternative visualizations.

# Schedule
 
Morning = 9h30 to 12h30. Afternoon = 13h30 to 17h30. (Coffee breaks included)

 * Day 1: advanced reporting with R Markdown
 * Day 2: visualization

During this class, we will work on a shared script ([link]({{< meta shared_script_url >}})).
